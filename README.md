SinSeq: Single-cell sequencing analysis toolkit
=======

The Single-cell Sequencing Analysis Toolkit (or SinSeq) provides various utilities for manipulating and analyzing data generated from Single-cell sequencing.


1. Preprocessing
-----------


Steps:  <br />   
0) .fastq --> .bam (alignment using bowtie, not included in this toolkit)    
1) Sort and reorder .bam files (according to the referen genome) based on the script bamGATKsort.sh   
2)




2. Initial CNV discovery (control-free calling)
-----------



3. Control-based CNV-calling 
-----------




4. Intratumor heterogeneity (clustering)
-----------
